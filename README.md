Leadbeater is a library for leveraging the interactive theorem proving and SMT checking abilities of Liquid Haskell to verify properties of neural networks. It is currently still under development. In the meantime, you may want to check out theirÂ cousin, [StarChild](https://github.com/wenkokke/starchild).
